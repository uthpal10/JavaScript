// package.json:
// This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, 
// description, dependencies, and other configurations.
// It's typically hand-edited and is meant to be human-readable and editable.
// Developers use package.json to specify the packages their project depends on, 
// along with the versions of those packages.

// package-lock.json:
// Introduced in npm 5, package-lock.json is automatically generated and updated by npm whenever 
// a new module is installed or the project's dependencies are modified.
// It provides a detailed, machine-readable description of the exact tree of dependencies that were installed, 
// including specific versions of each package and their dependencies.
// The purpose of package-lock.json is to ensure deterministic and reproducible builds across different development 
// environments and machines. It helps guarantee that all developers working on the project use the same 
// versions of dependencies.

// package.json is where you define your project's dependencies and configurations, 
// package-lock.json is automatically generated to lock down the specific versions of those dependencies, 
// ensuring consistency and reproducibility in your project's builds.
