// npx: This is the command-line tool that allows you to execute Node.js packages. It's particularly useful for 
// running packages that are not globally installed or for running specific versions of packages.

// wdio: This is the Node.js package (WebdriverIO in this case) that you want to run.

// run: This is a command or script provided by the WebdriverIO package. In this context, it's telling 
// WebdriverIO to run a test suite based on the configurations specified in the wdio.conf.js file.

// ./wdio.conf.js: This is the path to the configuration file (wdio.conf.js) that contains the settings and options 
// for your WebdriverIO test suite. The wdio command will use this configuration file to determine how the tests 
// should be executed, which browsers to use, what test files to run, and other settings.

// So, when you run npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js, 
// you're essentially telling Node.js to use the WebdriverIO package 
// to execute the test suite specified in the wdio.conf.js configuration file. 
// This command is commonly used in test automation workflows to kick off test runs using WebdriverIO.
