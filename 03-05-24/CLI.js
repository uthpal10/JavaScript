// "WDIO CLI" stands for WebDriverIO Command Line Interface. It's a tool provided by WebDriverIO, 
// a popular automation testing framework for web applications. The CLI allows developers and testers to interact 
// with WebDriverIO from the command line, performing various tasks such as initializing projects, running tests,
//  generating reports, and managing configurations.

// you can use the WDIO CLI to initialize new WebDriverIO projects.

// The CLI provides commands for managing and editing WebDriverIO configuration files (wdio.conf.js).
//  This is crucial for customizing test settings, specifying browser configurations, defining test suites, and more.

// With the CLI, you can execute automated tests written using WebDriverIO. This includes running entire test suites, 
// specific test files, or individual test cases.

// WebDriverIO CLI integrates with reporting tools to generate detailed test reports. 
// This helps in analyzing test results, identifying issues, and tracking test coverage.
