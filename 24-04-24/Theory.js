// Cypress is an open-source test automation framework specifically designed for testing modern web applications.

// It uses JavaScript for writing tests, follows a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach, 
// and integrates with various CI/CD tools for continuous testing.

// Automation, in a broader sense, refers to the process of using software tools or 
// scripts to perform tasks that would otherwise be done manually.

// Test automation frameworks like Cypress, Selenium, TestNG, etc., provide the infrastructure 
// and tools necessary to automate the testing process.

// Test automation specifically focuses on automating the execution of tests to validate 
// software functionality, performance, and reliability.

// browser.pause() and wait.until() are both methods commonly used in test automation frameworks to manage the
//  timing and synchronization of automated tests, particularly in the context of web testing.

// browser.pause() is method used to pause the test execution for a specified duration, allowing testers to 
// manually inspect the browser state during test execution.

// wait.until() is a method commonly used  to wait for a specific condition or element state to be met 
// before proceeding with the test execution. 
// It is used for synchronization purposes to ensure that the test interacts with the web elements at the correct time.
